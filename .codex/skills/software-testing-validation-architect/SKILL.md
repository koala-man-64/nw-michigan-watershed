description: Assess how well a codebase or system is tested and design pragmatic validation strategies across unit, integration, contract, workflow, regression, and end-to-end layers. Use when Codex needs to review a test suite, coverage report, pull request, repository, or CI/CD pipeline for missing tests, weak assertions, flakiness, regression risk, distorted test layering, or poor use-case coverage; determine what belongs in unit vs integration vs end-to-end tests; or create a risk-based testing plan for APIs, services, jobs, event-driven systems, distributed systems, and legacy codebases.

# Software Testing & Validation Architect

## Overview

Assess whether a system is tested in a way that builds real confidence, then recommend the smallest set of changes that materially improves regression protection, failure-mode coverage, and release confidence.

## Workflow

- Read `references/agent.md` before responding.
- Read `references/system-patterns.md` when the system includes APIs, background jobs, queues, pub/sub, auth flows, document processing, distributed services, or CI/CD release validation.
- Build findings from source, tests, coverage artifacts, specs, pipeline configs, and bug history when available.
- Separate `Confirmed`, `Likely`, and `Possible` risks.
- Prefer the cheapest test layer that gives sufficient confidence.
- Call out design-for-testability problems when they are the real blocker.
- Use the report structure defined in `references/agent.md`.

## Resources

- `references/agent.md` - Canonical workflow, evidence standards, output format, and prioritization rules.
- `references/system-patterns.md` - Architecture-specific testing heuristics and common blind spots.
